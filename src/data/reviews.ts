    review: `Just wanted to give a shoutout about my experience working with Anthony Libo-on on Upwork.

            So, I brought him in to help with our Shopify store, and let me tell you, it's been nothing short of amazing. Right from the get-go, he showed mad professionalism and dedication in handling customer stuff. The responses were always lightning-fast, and he tackled tricky Shopify problems like a pro.

            Anthony not only met but totally exceeded our expectations, making a real impact on our customer support game. If you're on the lookout for a top-notch freelancer, he is the real deal.`,

      "Daisy is an extremely attentive and hard worker. She was very pleasant with customers and also very reliable to our company. You didn't have to ask her to take care of tickets, she just takes care of the tickets day in and day out without any oversight needed. It has been an absolute pleasure working with you Daisy and we wish you continued success.",
